## Lab 2 Recap

Before starting with this lab, we will review the [the example 2 of Lab #2](https://github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/tree/master/lab2#example-2) step by step.

```sh
	cd lab2/Example2/quickstart
	open resources/META-INF/services.xml
```

---

**1. Check the service.xml file** 

```xml
	<!-- The name of the service -->
	<!-- Scope and nameSpace must be later matched inthe build.xml -->
	<service name="StockQuoteService" 
		scope="application"
		targetNamespace="http://quickstart.samples/"
	>
		<!-- a description of what the service does -->
		<description>Stock Quote Service</description>
		<!-- the classes that will process incoming messages to the service -->
		<!-- we are using standar message receivers already bundled with axis2 -->
		<messageReceivers>
			<messageReceiver
				mep="http://www.w3.org/2004/08/wsdl/in-only"
				class="org.apache.axis2.rpc.receivers.RPCInOnlyMessageReceiver"
			/>
			<messageReceiver
				mep="http://www.w3.org/2004/08/wsdl/in-out"
				class="org.apache.axis2.rpc.receivers.RPCMessageReceiver"
			/>
		</messageReceivers>		
		<!-- definition of the xml schema used by the service -->
		<schema schemaNamespace="http://quickstart.samples/xsd"/>
		<!-- specification of what Java class is being exposed as a service -->
		<parameter
			name="ServiceClass">samples.quickstart.service.pojo.StockQuoteService
		</parameter>
	</service>
```

---

**2. Check/Adjust the build.xml file** 

First, replace the properties AXIS2_HOME and AXIS2_HOME_TOMCAT to make it fit your local configuration

```xml
	<!-- replace them appropiately to match the places where these folders are
			in your computer -->
    <property name="AXIS2_HOME_TOMCAT" 
    	       value="/opt/apache-tomcat-7.0.39/webapps/axis2"/>
    <property name="AXIS2_HOME" 
    		   value="/opt/axis2-1.6.2"/>
``` 

For example, in your windows PC it might look like

```xml
    <property name="AXIS2_HOME_TOMCAT" 
    			value="C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.39\webapps\axis2"/>
    <property name="AXIS2_HOME" 
    			value="C:\axis2-1.6.2"/>
```

---

Appart from the typical "compile" you have *generate.wsdl* and a *generate.service*. 

```xml
	<!-- generates the wsdl of the service using java2wsdl and the service.xml -->
	<target name="generate.wsdl" depends="compile.service">
        <taskdef name="java2wsdl"
                 classname="org.apache.ws.java2wsdl.Java2WSDLTask"
                 classpathref="axis2.classpath"/>
        <!-- This is the key: java2wsdle creates the wsdle for a class -->
        <java2wsdl className="samples.quickstart.service.pojo.StockQuoteService"
                   outputLocation="${build.dir}"
                   <!-- remember, these two must be the same as in service.xml -->
                   targetNamespace="http://quickstart.samples/"
                   schemaTargetNamespace="http://quickstart.samples/xsd">
            <classpath>
                <pathelement path="${axis2.classpath}"/>
                <pathelement location="${build.dir}/classes"/>
            </classpath>
        </java2wsdl>
    </target>
	<!-- packages the compiled classes in a file and deploys the service -->
	<target name="generate.service" depends="compile.service">
        <!--Copy all the classes and the service.xml file to classes folder -->
        <copy toDir="${build.dir}/classes" failonerror="false">
            <fileset dir="${basedir}/resources">
                <include name="**/*.xml"/>
            </fileset>
        </copy>
        <!-- Create a packaged version of the service named "StockQuoteService" -->
        <jar destfile="${build.dir}/StockQuoteService.aar">
            <fileset excludes="**/Test.class" dir="${build.dir}/classes"/>
        </jar>
        <!-- this part is about already deploying the service to Axis2 -->
        <copy file="${build.dir}/StockQuoteService.aar"
              toDir="${AXIS2_HOME}/repository/services"
              overwrite="yes">  
        </copy> 
    </target>
```

---

**3. Generate WSDL and the packaged service (.aar)** 

```sh	
	ant generate.wsdl
	ant generate.service
```

**4. Check that the service has been deployed** 

```sh
	open http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/listServices
```

You should see something like:
 
![](https://raw.github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/master/lab2/resources/StockQuoteServiceDeployed.png)

---

class: center, middle

Remember, deploying the service is simply copying the generated .aar to the services folder of axis. In the same way *removing* the service is just deleting that file.   

---

**5. Check the service WSDL** 

WSDL will be covered in a future lecture: 

```sh
	open http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteService?wsdl
```

**6. Call on the available operations on the StockQuoteService** 

```sh	
	open http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteService/getPrice?symbol=IBM
```

The answer is a soap message as follows: 

```xml
	<ns:getPriceResponse xmlns:ns="http://quickstart.samples/xsd">
		<ns:return>42.0</ns:return>
	</ns:getPriceResponse>
```

---

The StockQuoteService class has also an update operation which if called, updates the stock value for a company symbol.

```sh	
	open http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteService/update?symbol=IBM&price=150
```

Calling the getPrice service now will give

```xml
	<ns:getPriceResponse xmlns:ns="http://quickstart.samples/xsd">
		<ns:return>150</ns:return>
	</ns:getPriceResponse>
```

---

class: center, middle

**7. Exercise** 

Now, take a couple of minutes to do exercise 3 from last session: 

Modify the *HealthProfileReader* and expose it through an axis2 web service ([solution](https://github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/blob/master/lab2/solutions/Ex3))

**Hint:** you won't need a main, but you will need to initialize your database just once for the whole class (see static blocks in java)

---

class: center, middle, inverse

# XML Navigation: XPath

Reading/Parsing XML documents 


---

## XPATH Introduction

* XPath is a **query language** designed for querying XML documents (actually, DOM trees)
* XPath uses path expressions to navigate in XML documents
* XPath contains a library of standard functions
* XPath describes paths to elements in a similar way an operating system describes paths to files
* XPath is a W3C recommendation: http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/

---

## XPATH Tree

Take a look again to the XPath tree you saw during lectures. What's the similarity with an xml document?

![](https://raw.github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/master/lab3/resources/Fig1-XpathTree.png)

---

## XML Documents: Nodes & Relationships

* bookstore is the **parent** of **book**; **book** is the **parent** of the two **chapters**
* The two chapters are the **children of book**, and the section is the **child of the second chapter**
* The two chapters of the book are **siblings** (they have the same parent)
* Library, book, and the second chapter are the **ancestors** of the section
* The two chapters, the section, and the two paragraphs are the **descendants** of the book
* It is also a **TREE!**
![](https://raw.github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/master/lab3/resources/Fig2-XmlNodesRelationships.png)

---

## Example 1: using xpath in java

* Open [lab3/Example1-XPATH/XPathTest.java](https://github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/blob/master/lab3/Example1-XPATH/XPathTest.java)
* Compile it
* Execute it

```java
	// we are using the library javax.xml.xpath.XPath
	import javax.xml.xpath.XPath;
	...
	public class XPathTest {
		  public static void main(String[] args)  throws ParserConfigurationException, SAXException,										IOException, XPathExpressionException {
		    // 1. read the xml file and parse it to a in-memory DOM tree
		    DocumentBuilderFactory domFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
		    domFactory.setNamespaceAware(true);
		    DocumentBuilder builder = domFactory.newDocumentBuilder();
		    System.out.println("Loading books.xml...");
		    Document doc = builder.parse("books.xml");
		    // 2. create an XPath object to evaluate an XPathExpression 
		    XPathFactory factory = XPathFactory.newInstance();
		    XPath xpath = factory.newXPath();
		    XPathExpression expr = xpath.compile("/bookstore/book/title/text()");
		    // 3. Operate on the result
		    Object result = expr.evaluate(doc, XPathConstants.NODESET);
		    NodeList nodes = (NodeList) result;
		    for (int i = 0; i < nodes.getLength(); i++) {
		        System.out.println(nodes.item(i).getNodeValue());
		    }
		  }
	}
```

---

## Exercise 1 (10 min)

* In the *lab3/my-solutions* folder, copy XPathTest.java and modify it to print also the authors 

---

## Node Selection

Think about the xml document for the bookstore

![](https://raw.github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/master/lab3/resources/Fig3-XmlDocument.png)

---

## Node Selection (1)

* A path that begins with a / represents an absolute path, starting from the top of the document 
	**/bookstore/book/title**
* Note: an absolute path can select more than one element
* A / by itself means “the whole document”
* A path that does not begin with a / represents a path starting from the current element
* book/title Selects all title elements that are children of book

---

## Node Selection (2)

* A path that begins with // can start from anywhere in the document.
* //title Selects every element title, no matter where it is.
* bookstore//title Selects all title elements that are descendant of the bookstore element, no matter where they are under the bookstore element.

```java
	XPathExpression expr = xpath.compile("//book[price " + condition + "'" + price + "']");
```

---

## Predicates

* Predicates are used to find a specific node or a node that contains a specific value.
* /bookstore/book[1] Selects the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element.
* /bookstore/book[last()] Selects the last book element that is the child of the bookstore element.
* /bookstore/book[position()<3] Selects the
* first two book elements that are children of the bookstore element.
* /bookstore/book[price>3] Selects all the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 3.

```java
	XPathExpression expr = xpath.compile("/bookstore/book[isbn='" + ISBN + "']");
```

---

## Attributes

* You can select attributes by themselves, or elements that have certain attributes.
* To choose the attribute itself, prefix the name with @
* //@lang Selects all attributes that are named lang
* To choose elements that have a given attribute, put the attribute name in square brackets
* //title[@lang='eng'] Selects all the title elements that have an attribute named lang with a value of 'eng'

---

## Wildcards
* "*" Matches all element node at this level
* /bookstore/* Selects all the children nodes of the bookstore element
* @* Matches all attribute node
* //title[@*] Selects all title elements which have any attribute
* node() Matches any node of any kind

---

## Several Paths

* By using the | operator in an XPath expression you can select several paths.
* //book/title | //book/price
	* Selects all the title and price elements of all book elements
* /bookstore/book/title | //price
	* Selects all the title elements of the book element of the bookstore element and all the price elements in the document


---

## Axes

* An axis is a set of nodes relative to a given node
* X::Y means “choose Y from the X axis”
* child::book Selects all book nodes that are children of the current node
* child::text() Selects all text child nodes of the current node
* child::node() Selects all child nodes of the current node
* ancestor::book Selects all book ancestors of the current node

```java
	XPathExpression expr = xpath.compile("//child::book[author='" + authorName + "']");
```

---

## Arithmetic Operators
* "+" add
* "-" subtract
* "*"" multiply
* div (not /) divide
* mod modulo (remainder)


---

## Boolean Operators

* = equals (Notice it’s not ==)
* != not equals
* value = node-set will be true if the node-set contains any node with a value that matches value
* value != node-set will be true if the node-set contains any node with a value that does not match value
* Hence, value = node-set and value != node-set may both be true at the same time!
* And
* Or
* not()
* The following are used for numerical comparisons only:
	* <, <=, >, >=


---

## Java and XPath types

* XPath and Java language do not have identical type systems
* XPath 1.0 has only four basic data types:
	* node-set
	* Number
	* Boolean
	* String
* The evaluate() method may return
	* org.w3c.dom.NodeList
	* java.lang.Double
	* java.lang.Boolean
	* java.lang.String
	* org.w3c.dom.Node
* When you evaluate an XPath expression in Java, the second argument specifies the return type you expect.

---

## Example 2: xpath advanced

* Explore **lab3/Example2-XPath/XPathAdvance.java** to see the examples of what we have seen in prevous slides
* Compile it
* Run it

---

## Exercise 2

* Replace the HashMap db in the HealthProfile Reader with a xml file as follows

```xml
<people>
    <person>
        <firstname>George R. R.</firstname>
        <lastname>Martin</lastname>
        <healthprofile>
            <weitgh>120</weitgh>
            <height>1.65</height>
        </healthprofile>
    </person>
    <!-- add more people to the db --> 
</people>
```

* Use xpath to implement methods like getWeight and getHeight
* Make a function which prints all people in the list with detail
* A function which accepts name as parameter and print that particular person HealthProfile
* A function which accepts weight and an operator (=, > , <) as parameters and prints people that fulfill that condition.

---

## Bonus Example: using xpath on the wild 

* Get [scraper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scraper/mbigbapnjcgaffohmbkdlecaccepngjd) (chrome only extension)
* Go to meteotrentino.it
* Inspect Element on top of the temperature
* Copy as XPATH (//div/div/span/strong)
* Scrape Similar
