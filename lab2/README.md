## ANT and Java

### Example 1
In the directory [lab2/Example1/src](https://github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/blob/master/lab2/Example1/src)
Open Test.java

	public class Test {
		public static void main(String args[]){
			System.out.println("Hello World!");
		}
	}

Now, compiled the class and execute the program. 

	javac Test.java
	java Test


---

That's the typical "Hello World" example. If a class in java has a an "public static" method called "main", this will be executed by the JVM when you execute it. 

Now, a more complete example that will serve you as a commented guide to how a java class look like is the [Person](https://github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/blob/master/lab2/Example1/src/pojos/Person.java) class. Immagine you want a program to read Person's [health profile](https://github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/blob/master/lab2/Example1/src/pojos/HealthProfile.java). Check the [HealthProfileReader](https://github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/blob/master/lab2/Example1/src/HealthProfileReader.java) to see how you use this classes in action. Again, compile it, execute it.  

Now, what if I have a giant project, with many classes, many source folders, many packages, and want to package them all into a single jar, or a directory, or simply want to automate build?. That's where ANT comes in.  

Ant is a Java-based build tool. A build tool automates repetitive tasks (e.g. compiling source code, running tests, generating documentation). Typically, without a graphical user interface (headless) directly from the command line. Others with a similar purpose are Maven and Gradle.

---

Take a look to the [build.xml](https://github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/blob/master/lab2/Example1/build.xml) as an example an ant build file. And execute it

	ant init
	ant compile


---

Now, the build folder has some compiled classes that can be execute it. To compile the HealthProfileReader execute: 

	ant compile-person
	
You can also execute things using ant. Try: 
	
	ant execute-test
	ant exeucte-hprofile

Finally, classes can all be packaged in one using jar files. Try it like this. 

	ant archive

---
	
In the build folder, there should be a jar file now (project.jar), whose main class is pointed to the HealthProfileReader. To execute it, run: 

	java -jar build/project.jar Pinco Pallino
	
What did you do? You have been executing ant targets (compile, init, archive, etc.) that are defined in the build.xml, each target indicating a list of tasks (i.e. commands) to be sequentially execute it. Take a look to the build.xml to see how they were defined.  

---

In summary, ant scripts define: 
* *Ant Project*: a collection of named targets. Each build file contains one project.
* *Ant Target*: a fixed series of ant tasks in a specified order that can depend on other named targets.
* *Ant Task*: something that ant can execute jobs, such as compile, create jars, copy.   
* *Ant properties*: immutable constants set once and used through the whole scritps

---

### Exercise 1
* First create a folder “my-solutions” under lab2 folder for your exercise solutions (do not change the lab source code, unless you want to deal with solving conflicts in the future :P)
* Make a ANT project as follows
	* Extend the HealthProfileReader adding the attribute BMI to the HealthProfile. 
	* Executing the HealthProfileReader should now receive the name, lastname and a third parameter indicating the “Health Measure” we want to see (e.g. “weight”, “bmi”). 
	* For the BMI formula, ask google. 
* The directory structure should be as follow
	* Main Directory (named after the project)
		* src: source files 
		* build: destination of built files
			* classes: java compiled classes  
		* dist: destination of packaged files (e.g. *.jar).
* Make build.xml file with the following targets
	* init: creates the build and dist directories
	* compile: compiles your project and put the classes in build/classes
	* archive: creates a distributable jar file in “dist”
	* execute: runs the project with three integer arguments
	* clean: goes back to the original state  

Try it! ([solution](https://github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/blob/master/lab2/solutions/Ex1))

### .gitignores
A brief pause in the lab session for a reminder. Please, don't push everything in your repository. For example, compiled things do not need to be versioned. So, use .gitignore files in your repo to define what should be ignored by git. There is already one in the root of the repo with this content: 

	# Compiled java classes (this is a comment)
	*.class
	
	# Package Files #
	*.jar
	*.war
	*.ear
	*/build/

## Axis2

Axis2 a web service engine that implement both client and server sides of web services (and, from v2, also REST services). It handles the generation/sending/receiving/dispatching of SOAP messages. It allows you to expose simple Java Classes with its methods and other web applications as web services. 

![axis2 middleware](http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/docs/images/fig02.jpg "Axis2 middleware")

In this part we will go through the process of installing axis2 and then using it to create one service. 

First, install tomcat. Go to apache [tomcat website](http://tomcat.apache.org/). Download the zip version of Tomcat 7.x. Unzip it somewhere (e.g. /opt or C:\) and Set environment variables. 

---

	# if you are in unix/linux/mac or you are using msysgit from windows
	export CATALINA_HOME=/opt/apache-tomcat-7.0.39
	
	# windows
	set CATALINA_HOME=C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.39

**Observation:** for those using msysgit, beware that the "\" is a escape characters, so you can use either *C:\\apache-tomcat-7.0.39* or */C/apache-tomcat-7.0.39* 

---

Start the server

	# if you are in unix/linux/mac or you are using msysgit from windows
	$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

	# windows
	%CATALINA_HOME%\bin\startup.bat

---

Now, go to http://localhost:8080/ and if you see the apache tomcat cat, you are fine. Next step: donwload and install [axis2](http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/download.cgi). You can either download the war package directly, or download the binary distribution, unzip it somewhere and then build the war. Let's do the second. For this, I downloaded the axis2-1.6.2-bin.zip distribution. 

	unzip axis2-1.6.2-bin.zip  
	mv axis2-1.6.2 /opt

---

Now, you need to enter the weabpp folder in the axis home and create the package war of axis2 (yes, using ant ;-) )

	cd /opt/axis2-1.6.2/webapp
	ant create.war
	...
	create.war:
		[war] Building war: /opt/axis2-1.6.2/dist/axis2.war
	...

---

Deploy the war in tomcat. For this, you need to access the tomcat manager in your browser. By default, Tomcat does not enable admin or manager access. To enable it, you will have to edit the $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml manually by adding the following (or uncommenting if it is there)

	<user username="admin" password="whateverpasswordyouwantiuseadmin" roles="manager-gui,tomcat"/>

---

Now, you can access the manager in  http://localhost:8080/manager/html and deploy axis war. Now that it is deployed, you can open axis2 

	Follow this link http://localhost:8080/axis2. 

Should show you a page with 3 links: services, validate, administration. Open validate. 

	Follow the link http://localhost:8080/axis2/axis2-web/HappyAxis.jsp

It should should show you a HappyAxis page with the list of needed libraries and their status (if they are or not in your system).  If the Happy Axis page is coming with GREEN color then it means that axis2 is successfully deployed. 

---

Now it’s time to test a service, 
	
	Follow this link http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/Version?method=getVersion

It shows you something like this

	<ns:getVersionResponse xmlns:ns="http://axisversion.sample">
		<ns:return>Hi - the Axis2 version is 1.6.2</ns:return>
	</ns:getVersionResponse>

Now, hit the link "administration" i the axis2 home. The default user/password is admin/axis2. From here, you can deploy other services. 

---

### Example 2
Let's do one example, using one of the samples that come with axis2 distributions. Go to the **Example2** folder of this repo (or, if you prefer, use the axis2 home samples folder)

	cd lab2/Example2/quickstart
		or (if you prefer) 
	cd AXIS2_HOME/samples/quickstart 

---

First, check the "service.xml" definition that it will be used to create a WSDL file describing a SOAP endpoint service based on the [StockQuoteService](https://github.com/cdparra/introsde2013/blob/master/lab2/Example2/quickstart/service/pojo/StockQuoteService.java) java class. This java class takes the stock code of a company (e.g., IBM) and returns its stocks value. Check the services.xml

	open resources/META-INF/services.xml
	
---

You should see this: 

	<service name="StockQuoteService" <!-- The name of the service -->
		scope="application"
		targetNamespace="http://quickstart.samples/"
		<!-- Scope and nameSpace must be later matched inthe build.xml -->
	>
		<!-- a description of what the service does -->
		<description>Stock Quote Service</description>
		
		<!-- the classes that will process incoming messages to the service -->
		<!-- we are using standar message receivers already bundled with axis2 -->
		<messageReceivers>
			<messageReceiver
				mep="http://www.w3.org/2004/08/wsdl/in-only"
				class="org.apache.axis2.rpc.receivers.RPCInOnlyMessageReceiver"
			/>
			<messageReceiver
				mep="http://www.w3.org/2004/08/wsdl/in-out"
				class="org.apache.axis2.rpc.receivers.RPCMessageReceiver"
			/>
		</messageReceivers>
		
		<!-- definition of the xml schema used by the service -->
		<schema schemaNamespace="http://quickstart.samples/xsd"/>
		
		<!-- specification of what Java class is being exposed as a service -->
		<parameter
			name="ServiceClass">samples.quickstart.service.pojo.StockQuoteService
		</parameter>
	</service>

---

This is the definition of the StockQuoteService. It defines: 

* one "service" with the name *StockQuoteService* 
* what java class it is going to be used as a *ServiceClass* (under params), exposing all of its public methods as services (in this case, the *samples.quickstart.service.pojo.StockQuoteService* class).  
* The other important parameters are *targetNamespace* and *schemaNamespace*, which later has to be reused in the ant build file (we will get there). 
* What receivers will be used to process incoming messages (the standard axis2 receivers org.apache.axis2.rpc.receivers).  

---

Now, you need a build.xml file to get this thing done: 

* **build.xml**: ant build file with the following three axis2 targets:
	* *generate.wsdl*: This target generates the StockQuoteService.wsdl file in the build folder, using the java2wsdl command. Make sure that *targetNamespace* and *schemaTargetNamespace* is same as in service.xml file.
	* *generate.service*: This target generates the axis2 archive (which is nothing but a jar actually) in the build folder under the name *StockQuoteService.aar*, which includes the *services.xml* and the compiled classes. You can use this *.aar file to deploy the service through axis2 webapp. 
	* *generate.client*: This target generates the client side classes. Make sure you run this after executing generate.wsdl so the MyService.wsdl file is present in the build folder.

---

Now, generate the WSDL file and generate the packaged version of the service doing the following
	
	ant generate.wsdl
	ant generate.service

And finally, we can deploy it by simply copying the *StockQuoteService.aar* in the services directory of axis2. The services directory is the following for our case. 
	
	$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/services/ 

You can now see that the StockQuoteServices is in the list of available services by going to 
	
	http://localhost:8080/axis2/axis2-admin/listService

If you click on the link to the service, you will see the wsdl specification of this SOAP endpoint

	http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteService?wsdl
	
And to call the specific service, you just need to ask for the service getPrice (which is a method in the StockQuoteService class definition) with the proper parameter as follows

	http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteService/getPrice?symbol=IBM
	
The answer is a soap message as follows: 
	
	<ns:getPriceResponse xmlns:ns="http://quickstart.samples/xsd">
		<ns:return>42.0</ns:return>
	</ns:getPriceResponse>
	
The StockQuoteService class has also an update operation which if called, updates the stock value for a company symbol. 

	http://localhost:8080/axis2/services/StockQuoteService/update?symbol=IBM&price=150
	
Calling the getPrice service now will give

	<ns:getPriceResponse xmlns:ns="http://quickstart.samples/xsd">
		<ns:return>150</ns:return>
	</ns:getPriceResponse>

Now, your turn. Do the exercises!!
